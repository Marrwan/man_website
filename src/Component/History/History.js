                Nigeria (MAN) was established in May, 1971 as a company limited
                by guarantee. The establishment of the Association was motivated
                by the desire to have a focal point of communication and
                consultation between industry on the one hand, and the
                government and general public on the other. Hitherto, there was
                no institutional organ whose central focus was to give meaning
                to the interests, problems and aspirations of the manufacturing
                sector.

                  The establishment of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria
                  was to provide a platform for the private sector to formulate

                  to governments efforts at policy formulation. MAN is in
                  business to create a climate of opinion in this country in
                  which manufacturers can operate efficiently and profitably for
                  the benefit of all. As the collective voice of its members,
                  MAN was established to promote and protect manufacturers
