      "MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA (MAN) CONCERNS OVER THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (CBN) GUIDELINES ON e-VALUATION AND e-INVOICING",
    date: "January 31, 2022 ",
    paragraphs: [
      "Background",
      "The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has examined the recent circular issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) with ref. no: TED/FEM/FPC/PUB/01/001 of 21st January, 2022 titled “GUIDELINES ON THE INTRODUCTION OF E-VALUATION, E-INVOICING FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT IN NIGERIA”.",
      "MAN appreciates the efforts of the CBN and by extension the Federal Government, to sanitize foreign trade transactions in Nigeria. Without a doubt, we are persuaded that   it has some measure of impact on the foreign exchange profile of the country, which appears to be a major reason for the guidelines.  It is however necessary that the apex Bank’s attention be drawn to some issues that require clarifications and others that should be reviewed. There is need to ensure that the CBN does not go ahead to implement the guidelines without accommodating the constructive inputs of stakeholders, especially those whose businesses would be negatively impacted.",
      "The Issues",
      "• We noted that the implementation date on the circular is scheduled for 1st February, 2022; whereas the guideline itself was issued on the 21st January, 2022.  This is just 11 days grace before implementation. This is rather hasty. A circular on monetary or fiscal guidelines requires adequate adjustment time. This is more so when it involves international trade and transactions; where a minimum of 90 days allowance of time is normally required, as many operators would have opened Form M and concluded deals either for import of export. Straightaway, one must say that transactions already embarked upon before the commencement of the guidelines should be exempted and the commencement date should be extended by a minimum of 90 days.  ",
      "• The new regulation is primarily aimed at achieving near accurate value of imports and exports in Nigeria. It says any Form M or NXP that bears a unit price in excess of 2.5% of the verified global checkmate price will not be approved. This is concerning as it will checkmate the opportunity of our exporters to derive higher value for their exports. Besides, we are worried about the determination of global price verification mechanism and benchmark prices.",
      "•What happens if some companies are able to negotiate better prices due to their scale of order and are able to get competitive lower prices? Will these competitive prices be within the benchmark? Clearly, this aspect of the policy will lead to several challenges on valuation down the line including a floodgate of valuation issues with Nigeria Customs Service (NCS).",
      "• We also seek clarification on paragraph D of the guidelines; wherein the CBN is directing that …” the content of the electronic invoice authenticated by Authorized Dealer Banks is only advisory for the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS)”. This means that the NCS may vary it, probably uplift the FOB when issuing the PAAR. MAN considers CBN and NCS as agencies of the Federal Government and hence should harmonized their functions in this regard. Otherwise, businesses and indeed our members, will be subjected to paying unnecessary and additional FOB upliftment by the Nigeria Customs Service. This is in addition to a situation that may arise where the CBN forces such importer or manufacturer to reduce its price if it is considered not in conformity with the benchmark pricing.",
      "• In paragraph H, the CBN directs supplier and buyers to transmit their authenticated invoices would be transmitted through the CBN appointed Service Provider to the Nigeria Single Window portal. While MAN considers this measure as a step to check perceived malpractices, we believed that the essence of Single Window’ policy is being diminished and this could introduce unnecessary bureaucracy with attendant multiple charges. We already contend with this type of anomaly and could ill afford any addition. It will also be a disincentive to local and foreign investors. ",
      "• Finally, the annual subscription fee charge of $350 per authentication by suppliers on the portal meant to maintain the system, is a clear disincentive to suppliers of imports to Nigeria, particularly raw materials and spares for manufacturers. This has potential of triggering a run-on Nigeria business by their foreign partners and simultaneously encourage these suppliers to look elsewhere in the region as well as the continent.",
      "Conclusion  ",
      "The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) therefore, would appreciate that the CBN considers all the issues raised above and suspend the policy guidelines for now; as well as give adequate consideration for a stakeholders’ dialogue with a view to addressing the concerns. There should also be a clear, step-by-step process of transaction under the guidelines. This is necessary to ensure that government does not inadvertently create a regime of chaos that will decelerate the already low level of activity in the manufacturing sector in particular and the economy in general. We should avoid a situation that will give the regulators a leeway to ride roughshod over private business owners who are already groaning under an inclement operating environment.",

    title:
      "MAN PERSPECTIVE ON THE SEPTEMBER 27, 2022 DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE (MPC) OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA",
    date: "",
    paragraphs: [
      "1.0 Preamble",
      "The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in Communique No. 144 of the Third Quarter 2022 meeting recognized the global economic tension occasioned by the Russian-Ukrainian war with the associated disruption of global supply chain, degenerating global financial situation and accelerating world inflation.",
      "Consequently, the Committee increased the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 150 base points to 15.5% with an asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; and Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) by 750 base points to 32.5%; while retaining Liquidity Ratio at 30%. The increase was aimed at moderating the high inflationary pressure on the economy and narrow the gap between the hitherto MPR of 14% and inflation rate which stood at 20.52% in August 2022 in order to improve the level real interest rate. Of course, real interest rate is critical to prospective investors who would want optimize their investment earnings.",
      "2.0 Implications for the economy and manufacturing sector",
      "The increase in the two monetary parameters, MPR and CRR portends worrisome negative consequences for the manufacturing sector, some of which include: ",
      "➢   Increased cost of borrowing by manufacturers, further beyond the extant double-digit rate, which disincentivize new investments in the sector;",
      "➢   Increased factor costs which feed into high product prices, making the sector uncompetitive;",
      "➢ 	High product prices, which makes patronage to plummet and lead to huge inventory of unsold manufactured products in the sector.",
      "➢	 High inventory of manufactured products will trigger reverse effect in the sector as manufacturing capacity utilization, production, employment, profit and tax contribution to national building will decline.",
      "3.0 Going forward  ",
      "In consideration of the prevailing scenario around increase in interest rate and access to funds, tougher times are ahead for the productive sector. Clearly, the increase in MPR from 14% to 15.5% will rub-off negatively on other rates and dash the hope for a single digit lending rate for the productive sector in the economy. Moreover, the observed continuous contractionary monetary policy posture without complimentary fiscal support may not effectively reduce the prevailing inflationary pressure on the economy. This is not unconnected with the fact that the current increase in Consumer Price index as reported by NBS is not largely driven by monetary phenomenon, as self-inflicted weak foreign exchange rate management can be linked to the pressure.  ",
      "An experiential x-ray of the prevailing economic stance revealed that domestic output gap due to the inefficiency of the macroeconomy, unguided industry development, inclement and high-cost operating environment, exploitative regulatory ecosystem and some externalities are predominantly responsible for the rising inflation that the nation is experiencing. ",
      "4.0 Conclusion",
      "It is important that the monetary authority strategically set in motion mechanism for wholistic balancing of the real interest rate, which is critical to investment and not just following leading economies to adjust Interest rate without considering domestic peculiarities. Interest rate (MPR), Inflation and Exchange Rate are triadically critical to investment and production. Balancing the rates in line with local aspiration is therefore imperative.  Regrettably, at the moment, other contributory factors like insecurity and externalities induced food shortage; Government’s excessive drive for internally generated revenue, increase in interest rate in the US; unsustainable and unpragmatic interventions in the forex market; the acute shortage of forex and unfriendly exchange rates are not only fueling inflation, but seriously depressing industrial production.",
      "Consequently, MAN is hopeful that the CBN will creatively go beyond the conventional monetary management system, because global economic dynamics are changing and conventional measures may no longer be effective. In the light of the above, we recommend as follows:",
      "➢ 	Upscale the current efforts at improving the availability of development-oriented funds at single digit interest rate, prioritizing industries.",
      "➢ 	Promote a more robust production centric forex management and intervention in official forex market, leveraging on sustained increase in crude oil price in the global market;",
      "➢ 	Give priority attention to meeting forex requirement of the industries vital inputs that are not available locally, to sustain and ramp-up production;",
      "➢	 Intentionally promote monetary and fiscal policy fusion; that is, the Central Bank of Nigerian and the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget & National Planning should jointly put complimentary measures in place in support of domestic manufacturing.",
      "➢ 	Emplace the framework that will facilitate harmonious implementation of relevant policy guidelines aimed at boosting productivity.",
      "Undoubtedly, the Implementation of these measures will enable industries to remain in business; increase aggregate output; improve contribution to GDP and ensure inclusive and sustainable economic growth.",

    paragraphs: [
      "1.0	PROTOCOL & INTRODUCTION ",
      "Your Excellency, on behalf of the National Council and members of MAN, I most sincerely thank you for always finding time to receive the leadership of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN). Clearly, this gesture speaks volume of your Excellency’s readiness to promote manufacturing in Nigeria and has again assured manufacturers of your commitment to drive economic growth through improved performance of the manufacturing sector.",
      "Firstly, Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you most sincerely for your esteemed association with us as we marked our 50th Anniversary and hosted our 49th Annual General Meeting. The grand finale of the twin event was held in October this year and you graciously directed the Secretary to the Government of the Federation to represent you when your official foreign trip made in impossible for you to attend in person. Your Excellency, our Association chose the occasion to rebrand! We now have a new Logo, Vision and Mission Statements, which was launched by the Secretary to the Government. It will be our pleasure to present the new logo to your Excellency with the during this visit!",
      "Secondly, we seize this unique opportunity to commend you for all your efforts at maintaining the sovereignty of our nation and restoring the economy to the path of recovery and sustainable growth on two occasions, in the last six years. We identify the progress made in infrastructure development; various reforms on the Ease-of-Doing-Business; and exemplary leadership in curtailing the spread of COVID-19 evidenced by relative low number of infection and fatalities when compared with many other countries in the world.",
      "2.0 RATIONALE FOR THE VISIT",
      "Your Excellency, today’s advocacy visit was largely motivated by two considerations. The first is to thank you for all the support that you have extended to the manufacturing sector since your assumption of office while the second is borne out of the urgent need to seek the support of your Government for the manufacturing sector to overcome the binding constraints to competitive Manufacturing in Nigeria. ",
      "3.0	CHALLENGES OF THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR ",
      "Your Excellency, we do not wish to bore you with the plethora of familiar challenges confronting the manufacturing sector. MAN has proactively articulated remedial measures for these challenges in the Blueprint for Accelerated Development of Manufacturing in Nigeria, which will be formally presented to your excellency within the first quarter of 2022.",
      "The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria appreciates that the Federal Government has addressed some of these challenges while others are receiving the attention of the relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government.  However, permit me your Excellency to highlight a few that could be addressed in the immediate term in order to improve the manufacturing operating environment: ",
      "i.	Inadequate Supply of Forex: Manufacturers have been finding it difficult to source forex for importation of machines and raw materials that are not available in the country. Whilst we commend and support the recent CBN policy on non-allocation of forex to BDCs, we are constrained to observe that it has not translated into any meaningful improvement in supply of forex to manufacturers. We therefore request for the intervention of Your Excellency to ensure the prioritization of allocation for the purpose of importing raw materials and vital machine and equipment that are not available locally. In addition, we request that your excellency to direct the Central Bank of Nigeria and Ministry of Industry Trade and Investment to engage the Association to find ways of driving forex to the manufacturing sector. ",
      "ii.	Inadequate Electricity Supply: Manufacturers still contend with inadequate electricity supply from the national grid and high electricity tariff from Distribution Companies coupled with the enormous cost of providing alternative energy at over N72.7billion, thereby limiting the competitiveness of manufacturing in Nigeria. While commending the Government for the ongoing reform in the power sector, we implore your Excellency to direct that the NERC should remove all the bottlenecks inhibiting manufacturers access to the Eligible Customer Scheme. As a matter of policy, significant amount of the 2000 MW stranded electricity in the system can be made available to manufacturers through this scheme.",
      "iii.	Poor Access to Long term fund: Your Excellency, limited access to long term loans and high cost of loanable funds are also jointly restraining the ability of the sector to produce at full capacity and adversely affecting the contribution of manufacturing to the Gross Domestic Product.  We applaud the efforts of Government aimed at resolving these issues through various stimulus packages, but regret to note that genuine and deserving manufacturers are not able to access the funds. We therefore recommend that a monitoring and evaluation platform involving the private sector be set up to oversight the allocation of these funds. This will ensure that the funds are judiciously allocated to genuine manufacturers have access to these incentives. ",
      "iv.	Patronage of Made in Nigeria Goods and Local Content Development: Your Excellency, we commend the wisdom of your administration instituting Executive Orders 003 and 005 on patronage of made in Nigeria goods and development of local content. We humbly request that Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government we mandated to strictly prioritize the patronage of made in Nigeria items in all their purchases and contracts. In the same vein, we urge Mr. President, as the chairman of the Presidential Motoring Committee for Implementation of Executive Order 005 to direct that the Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation to inaugurate the Secretariat that will implement the strategies for the Executive Order. As a test case of this initiative, we humbly request that Mr President direct SON to certified local manufacturers of LPG Gas Cylinders be specifically designated as priority provider of the 10 million Cooking Gas Cylinders to be procured by the Federal Government for 12 States in the Federation. ",
      "v.	Looming increases in Tax Rate: Mr. President we are deeply concerned about imminent increase in taxes, duty rates and excise duty particularly for Food and Beverages sub-sector. This is because the affected sub-sectors are currently groaning under multiple taxes, levies and fees from the different tiers of Government and the disposable income of the average Nigerian is already eroded causing high inventory of unsold manufactured products.  While appreciating that Government needs to generate funds to meet its rising social and economic obligations, we strongly opine that it is the tax base that should be expanded to capture the untaxed. The existing genuine and diligent corporate taxpayers should net be overburdened as this could be counterproductive and the envisaged increased revenue may not be realized. ",
      "vi.	African Continental Free Trade Area (AFCFTA) Agreement",
      " I want to most sincerely appreciate Your Excellency for ensuring that proper consultation and sensitization was carried out before the signing of the AfCFTA Framework Agreement. Now that we have signed, ratified and deposited the instrument of ratification at the repository, the National Action Committee (NAC) should be effectively supported to continue to vigorously engage the private sector and relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government to accelerate the putting in place of all structures required for beneficial trade.In this regard, we implore Government to urgently embark on the following: establish the Designated Competent Authority that will superintend the administration of Rules of Origin and Commission the automation of the Certificate of Origin, export and import documentation processes for AfCFTA transactions;",
      "4.0    CONCLUSION",
      "Your Excellency, as I conclude, I will like to specially thank you for the numerous initiatives, reforms and policies that have helped to steady the course of manufacturing in Nigeria. Government however needs to sustain the implementation of policies that have helped the economy to quickly recover from recession, survive the onslaught of COVID-19 and revive other initiatives that have suddenly gone quiescent.",
      "MAN is full of expectations that Government will continue to make Manufacturing a centerpiece of its economic agenda and the enabler for upscaling national output, employment and wealth creation. This is because of its very strong and productive linkages with Agriculture, Petrochemical and Solid minerals beneficiation.",
      "Mr President, I have no doubt that with your kind support we shall accelerate the building of a resilient manufacturing sector in Nigeria in the best interest of the economy and over two hundred million Nigerians. ",
      "Thank you.",

      "THE PRELIMINARY POSITION OF MAN ON THE MAY 24, 2022 DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE (MPC) OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA",
    date: "",
    paragraphs: [
      "1.0 Preamble",
      "In response to the domestic economic conditions in Q1 2022 and other related challenges, especially those associated   with the prevailing international financial and economic environment, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) recently reviewed its previous decisions. The Committee decided to deepen its contractionary monetary policy stance by increasing the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to 13.5% from 11.5%, which was fixed since September 2020. ",
      "The key rationale for upscaling the MPR stems from the need to curb the rising rate of inflation that recently peaked at 16.8%, ensure relative stability, sustain economic growth in the face of the high-level uncertainties in the global economy. The MPC however, retained the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5% and Liquidity Ratio was also retained at 30%.",
      "2.0 Implications for the economy and manufacturing sector",
      "	This is another level of increase in interest rates on loanable funds, which will no doubt upscale the intensity of the crowding out effect on the private sector businesses as firms have lesser access to funds in the credit market",
      "	It will spur upward review of existing lending rates dependent obligations of manufacturing concerns, which will drive costs Northward",
      "	Intensify demand crunch emanating from the heavily eroded disposable income of Nigerians, constrained access of households and individuals to cheap funds",
      "	Lead to rising cost of manufacturing inputs, which will naturally translate to higher prices of goods, low sales and enormous volume of inventory of unsold products",
      "	Exacerbate the intensity of idle capital assets, worsen the already declining profit margin of private businesses and heighten the mortality rate of small businesses",
      "	Further reduce capacity utilization, upscale the rate of unemployment, incidences of crime and insecurity as the capacity of banks to support production and economic growth is heavily constrained ",
      "	Reduce the pace of full recovery of the real sector, make manufacturing performance to remain lackluster and of course lead to leaner contribution to the GDP.",
      "3.0 The Position of MAN",
      "Clearly, the increase in MPR has widened the journey farther away from the preferred single digit interest rate regime. It is not manufacturing friendly considering the myriad of binding constraints already limiting the performance of the sector. MAN is therefore concerned about the ripple effects of this decision and its implications for the manufacturing sector that is visibly struggling to survive the numerous strangulating fiscal and monetary policy measures and reforms.",
      "Consequently, manufacturers are hopeful that the stringent conditionalities for accessing available development funding windows with the CBN will be relaxed to improve the flow of long-term loans to the manufacturing sector at single digit interest rate. The expectation is that MPC will ensure that future adjustments of MPR takes into consideration the trend of core inflation rather than basing decision on headline and food inflation. This will no doubt shield the sector of the backlashes from the 13.5% MPR, ramp up production and guarantee sustained growth in the overall best interest of the economy.",

      "1.0 INTRODUCTION",
      "Despite the higher oil prices as well as the improvement in terms of trade, the expansion of the growth of the Nigerian economy remains sluggishly above the population growth rate. The accompanying prospect of establishing a strong fiscal space and buoyant foreign reserve remains unutilized. Inflation is at a 17-year-high of 21.09% and petroleum subsidy payment is not only draining the government’s coffers but accelerating the path of the economy to a debt peonage. While fiscal indiscipline, heightening insecurity, slow COVID-19 recovery, oil theft and the war-induced energy crisis are the lingering factors driving the economic headwinds, recent environmental and climatic challenges are significantly leaving a negative mark.",
      "Recent report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealed that year-on-year real GDP growth of the Nigerian economy stood at 2.25 percent in the third quarter of 2022. At a real GDP value of N18.96 trillion, the latest performance signifies a shortfall of 1.78 percent point from 4.03 percent real GDP growth recorded in the third quarter of the previous year. It also indicates 1.29 percent point decline from the value of economic activities recorded in the second quarter of 2022. The nominal GDP of N52.26 trillion recorded in the third quarter represented a year-on-year increase of 15.83 percent from the value of N45.11 trillion recorded in the same quarter of the preceding year. The latest nominal growth rate exceeded the 15.03 percent and 15.41 percent respectively witnessed in the preceding quarter and the corresponding quarter of 2021.",
      "2.0 IMPLICATION FOR THE NATIONAL ECONOMY",
      "Jobless Growth: The declining growth is an indication of lower production and lower employment. Therefore, the continuous downturn of the economy has further validated the urgent need to release an updated unemployment rate that corresponds with the current economic situation. The last published figure was in December 2020 at 33.33. Analysts had projected that the country's rate of unemployment is well above the 40% mark.",
      "Setback on the Fight against Poverty: In an economy with an average population growth rate of 2.6 percent, the recent real GDP growth of 2.25 percent implies that real GDP per capita growth has depreciated by 0.35 percent. This is a clear indication that more Nigerians have been thrown into the poverty trap and will also result in the country being downgraded from a middle-income to a low-income economy.",
      "Sub-optimal Revenue Generating Capacity: The skewness in the sectoral contribution in favour of the non-oil sector gives a clear indication that the Nigerian government has not been able to fully optimize the country’s revenue potential especially for the fact that majority of the operators in the informal segment are in the service sector. Notwithstanding, the growth slowdown will result in higher unemployment that can diminish the taxable capacity of individuals and in turn worsen the debt-to-GDP and debt service-to-revenue ratios.",
      "Low Diversification Drive: Despite 94.34 percent contribution of the non-oil sector, the Nigerian economy is still far from being diversified considering that the oil sector currently accounts for about 80 percent of the country’s export earnings which is less balanced in comparison with South Africa’s top four export earners: mineral products (25 %), precious metal (17%), vehicles and aircraft vessels (12%) and steel products (12%). The implication is that the Nigerian economy is still highly vulnerable to oil price shock. Also, in terms of inter-sectoral linkages, a lot of domestic companies still largely depend on imported raw materials to meet more than 50 percent of their production capacity.",
      "Further Decline in Growth: The Nigerian economy is a mono-cultural economy that is overly dependent on the oil sector while other sectors continue to suffer from Dutch Disease. Surprisingly, the rise in oil price has contributed to several headwinds, such as increasing petroleum subsidies, increasing refining cost, limited investment in oil infrastructure and theft on the pipelines which have all retrogressed the oil sector. Hence, is projected that economic growth will decline further in subsequent quarters.",
      "Slow Development: Nigeria’s credit rating will be further affected as high economic growth is one of the indictors of sustainable debt. In recent time, Moody’s and Fitsch had downgraded the country’s credit rating. It is expected that the credit rating will further worsen and significantly limit the country’s chances in sourcing for external development funds. This will inevitably slow down the pace of developmental projects.",
      "3.0 IMPLICATION FOR THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR",
      "The data provided by the report shows that Food, Beverage & Tobacco (48.8%), Textile, Apparels and Footwear (18.6%) and Cement (11.72%) were the top three contributors of the manufacturing sector in the third quarter of 2022, although only the Cement Industry recorded a higher contribution than the figure in the preceding quarter. In terms of a year-on-year real growth performance, the top three leading sub-sectors included Chemical and Pharmaceutical Products (11.09%), Cement (4.13%) and Non-Metallic Products (4.00%). On the other hand, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Products, Wood & Wood Product and Basic Metal Iron & Steel were the top three improved sub-sectors in the period under review. However, the manufacturing sector accounted for 8.59 percent of real GDP in the third quarter of 2022 which is marginally lower than the 8.96 percent recorded in same quarter of 2021 and 8.6 percent recorded in the preceding quarter of 2022. On a year-on-year basis, the sector grew by -1.91 percent in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 4.29 percent in the third quarter of 2021 and 3 percent recorded in the second quarter of 2022. This represented a -6.2-percentage point and -4.91 percent point decline from the growth witnessed in 2021 Q3 and 2022 Q2 respectively. The overall decline in both aggregate and sectoral performances could have far-reaching adverse effects on the manufacturers. Dominant among these are:",
      "Lower Manufacturing Turnover: The GDP growth slowdown will most likely result in higher unemployment rate. Coupled with high inflation rate, the economy is likely to face higher misery index that worsens the poverty level and further shifts consumers away from elastic manufactured goods. This will eventually result in drastic reduction of patronage and lower sales turnover.",
      "Heightened Forex Challenges: The slag in the diversification drive implies further dependence on imported raw material and machinery. Hence, the forex crisis bedeviling the sector is not likely to be resolved anytime soon.",
      "Slow Infrastructural Development & Reduction in Credit Intervention: Considering that the revenue generating capacity of the government is hampered by high unemployment, the limited funds will slow down the provision of infrastructure and credit facilities necessary to boost productivity of the manufacturing companies. Otherwise, the government will resort into more borrowings and put the country in debt peonage.",
      "Fall in Manufacturing Investment: The negative growth of the sector’s GDP sends a strong signal to potential investors in the sector. The impending result is negative investors’ sentiments and pessimism against provision of critical raw materials, technology and technical know-how required to promote the industry.",
      "Nigeria’s path to economic growth, industrialization and sustainable development has been compromised by inadequate attention to the numerous pressing challenges of the manufacturers who are meant to be the propellers of its long-term economic agenda. Achieving a stable rapidly-growing economy would require taking head-on the daily bottlenecks confronted by business owners within the manufacturing sector, considering its active inter-linkages with other key sectoral drivers of the economy. Amidst the numerous challenges, forex scarcity, multiple taxation, exorbitant interest rate, high-cost business operating environment, smuggling, insecurity, energy crisis and epileptic power supply are leading the pack. In order to restore the sector to an enviable position in the global business environment and in turn propel an inclusive growth of Nigerian economy, MAN hopes that the government will committedly: ",
      "	Facilitate the formal service sector to widen tax net and avoid multiple imposition of tax on the manufacturing companies. ",
      "	Tackle insecurity and smuggling by upscaling capacity building and providing adequate security equipment and technology for surveillance and intelligence gathering.",
      "	Continue to involve all stakeholders to play a vital role in supporting security along the oil infrastructure while also ensuring they are beneficiaries of the awarded surveillance contract.",
      "	Deploy means to reduce unemployment and boost productivity of the manufacturing by encouraging local sourcing of raw materials, improving infrastructural developments, resolving all credit and forex-related challenges, ensuring implementation of the Executive Order 003 and imposing cost-reflective electricity tariff and energy prices.",
      "	Jettison the failing hard peg policy and establish a clear and transparent market framework to guide the interventions of the CBN in the forex market.",
      "	Synergistically align monetary and fiscal policies while also curbing fiscal deficits by the gradual removal of fuel subsidy backed with appropriate palliatives for the poor.",
      "	Tackle flood disaster adopting erosion control mechanisms, early warning and emergency services as well as flood risk assessment and ecological funds ",
      "	Upscale electricity generation and build super grids that are regionalized to avoid continuous national system collapse and ensure a more robust transmission infrastructure.",
      "	Further reduce the reliance of the country on imported products and raw materials by encouraging local sourcing through a comprehensive and integrated incentivized system since Nigeria is largely bearing the brunt of imported inflation.",
